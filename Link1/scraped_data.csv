We also prohibit the use of harmful stereotypes, which we define as dehumanising comparisons that have historically been used to attack, intimidate or exclude specific groups, and that are often linked with offline violence.

We also protect refugees, migrants, immigrants and asylum seekers from the most severe attacks, though we do allow commentary and criticism of immigration policies.

According to the Union Govt Sample Nation Wide Survey Conducted by the office of Registrar General & the Census Commissioner in 2014, 70.7 Percent of women in India are non-vegetarians. Contrary to popular belief, India is predominantly a non-vegetarian country even though vegetarianism is often assumed as the norm in India.

According to this report, there are a few states where people are primarily vegetarian ‚Äì Rajasthan, where more than 70 per cent are vegetarian, Haryana and Punjab follow closely with number of vegetarians ranging from 65 to 70 per cent.
